# set_disjoint

There are `2 x N` nodes in an undirected graph, and a number of edges connecting some nodes. In each edge, the first value will be between `1` and `N`, inclusive. The second node will be between `N + 1`  and `2 x N`, inclusive.

Given a list of edges, determine the size of the smallest and largest connected components that have `2` or more nodes. A node can have any number of connections. The highest node value will always be connected to at least `1` other node.

Note Single nodes should not be considered in the answer.
